"""Strictly-typed wrappers for rich_click decorators with partially-unknown types.

rich_click ships ``py.typed`` but re-exports click's decorators, whose
``ParamType[Unknown]`` parameters make pyright (strict mode) report
``reportUnknownMemberType`` at every call site. Wrapping the affected decorators
here behind explicit, fully-known signatures keeps the rest of the code
strict-clean without disabling the rule. This module is the single boundary that
touches the untyped surface, so the only ``# pyright: ignore`` for this gap lives here.

Other click members (``command``, ``group``, ``Path`` …) type cleanly and are
still used directly as ``click.X`` at call sites.
